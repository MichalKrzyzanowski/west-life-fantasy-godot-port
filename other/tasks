- enhancements
	- split up stats (hp, dmg, etc) from combat stats
		- stat scalers should be part of said split
			- both stats + scalers can be reused on weapon/armour stats + upgrades
		- combat stats resource should be renamed and hold only level, xp, etc. data
		- name = CombatProperties? CharacterProperties? EntityProperties?
	- reason: combat stats are already well reusable for weapons/armour
		- gear can have levels and could potentially level up just like a character would
			- e.g. ratchet & clank style
			- level could track current weapon upgrade

+------+

	- movement
	- camera tracking player
	- shooting
- desert overworld add boulder/grass/lake tilesets
	- add town and cactus props

		- fix issue where bullet is rendered on top of the instructions board, not below
- player party
	- add party system
	- add stats and leveling
	- add possible player characters
		- should have different stats and growth
- saving/loading

	- one save slot only
- main menu
	- add main menu screen
	- add party select screen
	- add load option
	- add options screen with basic options
		- sound volume/mute
- camp menu
	- party stats
	- inventory menus e.g weapon/armour management
	- add empty orbs, without logic
- combat
	- rework player to be a resource instead of a scene
		- the data should be used when creating party members during combat
	- implement ui
	- add overall mechanics (fight, defend, flee)
	- add extra ui (level bar, enemy hp bar)
- refactor code base:
	- camp_character_stats_box
- towns
	- map transitions
	- add town scene
- buglist
	- when rapidly pressing esc during fade in/out, small chance of pausing the game and hard locking
	- camp menu can be opened during fade in/out transition when transitioning from map to map
	- loading game messes up map tiles i.e. path is glitched, looks like path tex with river tex, river is replaced by boulder tex
		- also happens when when selecting new game
		- caused by older version of godot 4.2. fixed on godot 4.3+
	- mouse is not registered in the camp menu, unless the camp menu is ran individualy
		- fix: all mouse events stopped on fader panel
	- godot 4.3: main menu continue button is not greyed out when no saves are present
	- godot 4.3: main menu continue button is smaller than the rest
		- specifially affecting disabled button, theme might be broken
		- fix: edit theme button margins for all modes i.e. normal, disabled, toggle, etc.
	- upgrading a weapon upgrades all instances of this weapon
	- using last consumable in a stack causes a crash due to description being called on null
	- using healing items increases character max level by 9999 (related to CombatStats.add() method)
	- party member combat hp is displayed as floats
	- camp menu is broken when entering a town
		- game is not paused when entering town (can still shoot when camp menu is open)
		- caused by clinic's wacky exit functionality..
	- xp is not loaded correctly, always defaults to 0
	- overworld player does not get removed when a battle is lost
		- need death screen and save prevention after failed battle
	- quiting the game right after finishing a battle causes the game to load into the previous battle scene
	- if first party member is dead, the player still has to select action for that player before cursor moves to the alive party member
	- healing items no longer heal
		- item has 0 hp by default meaning has_hp_depleted is set true by default
		- caused by duplicate method when adding items to inventory
	- loading the game breaks quest task completion
		- creating a new save and instantly reloading causes boss encounters to break quest
		- if quest is already saved in QuestManager, start() method is never called thus important signals are not connected
- enhancements
	- move project to godot 4.3
		- convert tilemaps to tilemaplayers
- refactor
	- rework game world structure & player
		- create a main scene that has following:
			- world: node that holds the map details, makes it easy to manage maps
			- player: characterbody2d that is the overworld player. should be seperated from playable maps.
				- will make it easier to transition from map to map
			- ui: players hud, camp menu, etc. this should not be part of the player scene in the first place.
				- easier to manage and update future inventory
				- no need to rebuild player ui everytime player moves maps
			- extras: that can be extra items such as faders, etc.
		- scenes that need to fetch e.g. world node can use a utils resource:
			- said utils res would have paths for each main node
		- update saving:
			- should save the main scene and any autoloads
		- issues:
			- fix editor errors for transition area, fails to fetch main nodes because of @tool
				- moved onready var declarations to ready()
			- combat has missing sprites for enemies and party
				- fixed itself lol

	- add elements

		- speed: governs turn frequency in combat
		- luck: governs loot drop quality + quantity

- add cheat codes
	- section in main menu
	- possible cheats:
		- monke mode: makes the game yellow with "unique" sound effects

		- evil mode: enemies are added to party select mode, replacing the party members
			- party members are added to the pool of desert enemies
		- where sprites?: party members are all replaced by secret "snail" class
			- inside joke from development
		- are you ok?: replaces all sounds to allexis walk meme
		- alcoholic: replaces all potions with alcohol, that no longer heals you
- bring back cut content
	- cut content from original unity version of the game should be brought back:
		- interactions: able to read signs, talk to npcs
		- npcs: walk around the town etc.
		- make all weapon + armour from shops usable + upgradable
