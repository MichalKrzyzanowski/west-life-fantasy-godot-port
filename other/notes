- converting unity to godot transform:
	- move decimal right 2 times i.e. x100. e.g. 0.75 = 75.0
	- reverse negative number on y axis e.g. 1.25 = -1.25

- item use function:
	- part of base item class
	- parameter: list of entity_properties objects
	- returns: integer success code ( 0=pass, 1=fail)
	- base use: print item description
	- used for:
		- using items e.g. potion to heal party member(s)
		- equip weapon on party member
		- party member(s) take dmg, gain/lose gold, lose items, etc.
			- whacky!

- damage formula:
	- reduction: attack / 100 * (target_def * target_def_muliplier)
	- total_attack: attack + weapon_attack
	- final: total_attack - reduction (clamped at 1/0?)
	- full formula: attack + weapon_attack - (attack / 100 * (target_def * target_def_muliplier))

- transitions:
	- better off to have to two locales per transition point:
		- origin and target locales
		- target locale takes you to the next map
		- origin locale stores data of map that the transition point is located in e.g. desert map
		- previous locale is used to store the origin locale when moving to the target locale, so that we can move back to the previous locale with ease
		- if target locale = null, go back to previous locale
	- need to support mutliple entrance locations to the same locale e.g.
		multiple towns in desert map should lead to same town scene and back to
		different position on the desert map
	- current solution:
		- locale data: name, entrance pos, and scene file
		- go to scene and update player position to entrance pos
	- maybe?
		- track name of locale player is entering
		- use dict of locales when exiting, match the name of the previous locale
		- if locales dict == 1, no need to match locales

- combat system:
	- ui:
		- interface:
			- needs:
				- gold reward
				- xp reward
				- current entity name
				- current entity damage
				- target name
			- solutions:
				- add actions and target reference to generic_entity script
				- create on_turn_end(entity) signal
				- connect signal to combat interface
		- party stats box:
			- needs:
				- member health
				- member name
				- member xp
				- member required xp
			- solutions:
				- add entity_properties reference
				- connect party stats box to party member stats signals:
					- hp changed
					- xp changed

- map transition system (door system?) maybe??
	- door class/scene:
		- holds scene to load
		- holds position of player to store, that is the position of the player before the door
	- autoload manager that stores previous door used

- the player should not be a child of any of the maps (town, desert)
	- player should not be destroyed when switching maps

- general code refactor:
	- rename all load/preload vars to PascalCase
	- fix instructions board

- saving system:
	- what to save:
		- party members:
			- name
			- combat stats
		- inventory:
			- items:
				- count
			- weapons:
				- upgrade level
				- damage
			- armor:
				- upgrade level
				- defence
		- overworld:
			- current scene (either town or desert)
			- position
	- when choosing new game:
		- create party and append each member to party manager
	- when choosing continue game:
		- check if save file present
		- load from file if save file present
		- add members to party manager
	- how to save:
		- first, remove the current scene
		- load in the singleton saved items e.g. items, party
		- then, load map data
	- when the game is actually saved:
		- when opening the camp menu
		- when leaving the combat scene

- party system:
	- base combat entity class (name = combat_stats)
		- create entity resource that holds all necessary stats
			- hp/max hp
			- damage
			- defense
			- xp/required xp
			- level
			- stat scalars
				- hp, damage, required xp, etc.
			- weapon (extra damage)
			- armour (extra defense)
	- create an entity scene for each combat entity in the game
		- party members:
			- fighter
			- mage
			- thief
			- black belt
		- enemies:
			- Snail
			- Cactus
			- Bandit
			- DesertWarrior
			- DesertShinobi
			- DarkShinobi
			- ShadeShinobi
		- bosses
			- BossBoss
			- BossSpy
			- BossMan
			- BossWalk
			- BossBossBoss
			- BossWif
		- combat scene will have an enemy spawn table, with percent chance to spawn each enemy
